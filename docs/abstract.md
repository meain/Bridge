# Bridge

We are living in a age where the art of technology and the art of teaching has come a long way,
now with **bridge** we are indenting to interlace those to make something that will help **bridge** the gap between teachers and students.
Currently even though we use technology to help to reach out to students its is much more of a flaky situation.
The communication is spread over different channels, sometimes a phone call, sometimes a text message, and sometimes nothing at all.
Currently there lacks and efficient way for teachers to communicate to students directly as a group or individually.
Also there is no easy way for the students and teachers to keep track of the tasks they have in hand.
It is at times really hard for teachers to reach students most of time and they end up relying on the class representative to deliver the message which in itself is not bad but is less efficient.

With **bridge** we are indenting to solve all the above stated problems by implementing a way in which the teachers and students can communicate seamlessly with each other,
keep track of everything that they have to do, get replies asap and just about anything that helps make the student teacher communication much more effective and easy.
In here we will have ways in which both students and teachers can interact with each other, share messages personally or as a group, etc.

Teaches will be able to contact to a group of students ( a class ) or specifically to an individual student.
Teachers will be able to post all details about assignments and projects to a common calender ( name, due date, etc ) which will be visible to the respective students at any time.
Teachers can also publish any results as well as remarks about a student or a group.

Now, for students they can always see what is coming up next in their calender and decide on how much to procrastinate very easily.
Students will also be able to have a chat with a teacher to clarify anything he/she has doubts on.
Also, we will have a platform where the studnets can submit their assignments online, and get the remarks and result for it right there.
