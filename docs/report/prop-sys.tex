\section{Proposed system}

With our solution we are aiming to provide a simple and intuitive interface for the student. We are also looking forward to provide a student centric model in which the student will able to track his classes at the university.\\

Once the user get registered through their google sign in (which makes the signin and verification process efficient and easy ). The user will be provided with a popup menu in which they could select their respective division head and to which course they are enrolled to.after the completion of sign in process, we will have a wide range of options which include attendance tracking system, notes adding, which could include lecture videos, images and much more feature which make learning easier, it tend to have an added feature of upcoming events which help to clear the backlogs and make the work as timid and as clean as possible\\

\begin{itemize}
\item This system is developed in such a way that even a naive user can also operate the system easily.
\item This system is also secure as the database is managed only by
the administrator of the system.
\item It has an error free verification mechanism
\item Easy way of accessing records and tracking attendance
\end{itemize}
