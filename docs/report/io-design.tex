\section{Input Output design}

\subsection{Input design}

The input part of the project includes ways for the user to add data like attendance and notes to the system. It also provides an interface for teacher to add upcoming events for specific classes.

The user can log into our system using their Google account and then start adding up notes and marking their attendance.

\subsection{Output design}

The output part of the project is the more important part as the main goal of the project is to provide the user with information about the education institution actives at their fingertips.

Without any effort the user can view upcoming events and todays day in a glance. They main page also gives them a heads up on the upcoming events in the near future which lets them act wisely.

The user can also view all the notes they have taken down during the year, check their attendance.
