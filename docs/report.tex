\section{Abstract}
\vspace{1em}

\newpage

\section{Introduction}
\hspace{1em}

\Large
The most important aspect of a academic studies for a student is the involvement of the teachers in the matters of the students. It is also very vital for the student to stay updated about what is happening in the college. With this project we aim to do just that. We are creating a platform that can help the students to easily stay up to date on what is happening in their academic matters. They have an easy and intuitive way to see what is in their calendar.\\

\vspace{1em}
\Large
Our platform also provides an effective way for the student to track his daily activities at the academic institute by giving then a simple and efficient platform to take notes and track their attendance. This, we think is a great tool that will help the student of the academic institution to be able to track his time at the institution.\\

\vspace{1em}
\Large
The platform with its ability to take down notes for the classes they are attending in the university, in a platform that has their timetable and other data integrated along with it is a huge bonus for the student as it gives them a seamless way to take down notes for a specific period and let them filter it and get all the dada beautifully presented to them which is a huge bonus for a student.

\section{System study}
\hspace{1em}

\subsection{Existing system}

\Large
The present system is ineffective in maintaining a student centric model. It mainly consisted of web applications and very few mobile applications. The traditional way of maintaining record is time consuming, not easily accessible ,requires a computer, less user friendly, and laborious.\\

\Large
Apart from these all the system we have currently are mostly teacher centric which leads to a hard time for the students to navigate and find what they need.\\

\Large
Here are some disadvantages of existing system:
\begin{itemize}\item Time consuming\item Not easily accessible
\item Teacher centric\item Less student friendly
\item Laborious
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection{Proposed system}

\Large
With our solution we are aiming to provide a simple and intuitive interface for the student. We are also looking forward to provide a student centric model in which the student will able to track his classes at the university.\\

\Large
Once the user get registered through their google sign in (which makes the signin and verification process efficient and easy ). The user will be provided with a popup menu in which they could select their respective division head and to which course they are enrolled to.after the completion of sign in process, we will have a wide range of options which include attendance tracking system, notes adding, which could include lecture videos, images and much more feature which make learning easier, it tend to have an added feature of upcoming events which help to clear the backlogs and make the work as timid and as clean as possible\\

\begin{itemize}
\item This system is developed in such a way that even a naive user can also operate the system easily.\item This system is also secure as the database is managed only bythe administrator of the system.\item It has an error free verification mechanism\item Easy way of accessing records and tracking attendance
\end{itemize}
